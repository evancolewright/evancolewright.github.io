  <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Hello! Γειά σου! And welcome to my first blog post!</p>
<p>This is something I feel has been a long time coming. I’ve been an avid programmer since I was a kid, and I’ve also always had somewhat of a knack for writing. So it only makes sense that I combine the two loves and make a somewhat precarious lovechild — my own blog.
I’ve considered setting up a blog for years but never followed through for two main reasons.</p>
<p>The first (and primary) reason was that I didn’t know if I’d be able to stay active. My fear was that my blog would end up like most others I’d seen on the internet: the last post from five years ago&hellip; and then nothing. Total silence. Digital crickets. And honestly? I’m still not entirely sure I can keep up!</p>
<p>The second reason was that I was hell-bent on designing a custom site from scratch and wanted to avoid using any kind of “template.” That only made things more complicated and ended up being a huge demotivator, especially since I already wasn’t sure I’d have the inclination to write consistently in the first place.
So needless to say, I’ve trashed that requirement. And the great news? This blog is built with Hugo and without trying to sound like an ad, it really did make everything seamless. All I had to do was set up my theme and boom: it works. Pretty neat if I do say so myself!</p>
<h2 id="what-will-i-be-writing-about">What Will I Be Writing About?</h2>
<p>So what exactly do I plan to post here?
Honestly, I&rsquo;m not entirely sure of everything yet. But I do know that most of it will probably fall under two broad topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Programming</p>
<ul>
<li>API and mobile development</li>
<li>Artificial intelligence</li>
<li>Various other new technologies I’m currently exploring&hellip;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Early Christianity</p>
<ul>
<li>The Gospels</li>
<li>The historical Jesus</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Yep — I get that those are two relatively&hellip; divergent subjects, especially to be writing about on the same blog.
As for the programming aspect, I’ve worked as a software engineer for the past couple of years now and have been fortunate to learn a lot during that time. I&rsquo;ve also been coding as a hobby since I was a kid.</p>
<p>As for early Christianity and theology, that’s currently just a hobby for me that I picked up over the past year. I actually have aspirations to pursue an advanced degree in divinity or similar in the future, but first I need to complete my bachelor’s. For now, Im just reading a lot of books, listening to podcasts, and I guess now I&rsquo;m trying my hand at writing about it too.
It might’ve made more sense to split these into two separate blogs, but like I already said&hellip; motivation. So I figured I’d just tag each post accordingly and call it a day for now.</p>
<h2 id="closing-notes">Closing Notes</h2>
<p>Overall, my main goal is just to get my thoughts out of my head and onto paper (or markdown documents, in this case), whether it ends up helping someone else, or simply giving me something to look back on later. Either way, I think it’ll be worth it!</p>
<p>Anyways, I should probably get to writing&hellip; Thanks for stopping by and giving my first post a read, and I hope to see you around!</p>
