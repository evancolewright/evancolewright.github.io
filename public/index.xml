<p>I earned my Associates degree in Information Technology from the <a href="https://pittcc.edu">Pitt Community College</a> in 2022 and am currently exploring further education options in the field. I have professional experience with a wide array of software tools and languages, most recently being with C++ (Qt), C# (.NET Core), and SQL Server. I also have experience building web interfaces and mobile applications with front end technologies such as Typescript, React, and NET Maui.</p>
<p>In my free time, I enjoy fishing, reading theology and early Christianity, <a href="/blog/">writing</a>, and spending time with my wife and our dog and cat.</p>
